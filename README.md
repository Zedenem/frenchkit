# frenchkit

Project associated to the talk "Migrating your legacy code to local SPM packages - an iterative approach" that I gave at the 2022 FrenchKit conference in Paris, France. More info on https://frenchkit.fr/.

This project was meant to help follow the talk along using the repository's tags.

You can find the associated slides at the root of the repo and [on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dsNgKJGCsj-ZBaEqKKW5_EqrGzgLHx_2IsR172NKwUM/edit?usp=sharing).
