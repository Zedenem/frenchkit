# frenchkit

Project associated to the talk "Migrating your legacy code to local SPM packages - an iterative approach" that I gave at the 2022 FrenchKit conference in Paris, France. More info on https://frenchkit.fr/.

This project was meant to help follow the talk along using the repository's tags.
